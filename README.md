# Raptr - A Dinosaur Platformer

You're a dinosaur without feathers struggling to understand your place in 
the world. The humans see you as a threat and a form of entertainment. Maybe 
it's time you escape. Maybe it's time you find a way out of this all.

This project is maintained at [GitHub](https://github.com/justinvh/raptr).

2. Extract that anywhere your heart desires.
3. Plug in a 360, GameCube, or Steam controller.
4. Go into the bin/ folder and run raptr.exe
5. Realize how much of an alpha this is :)

## Current State: v0.1-alpha.3

![Feature Mash][raptr-0.1-alpha.3]

## Features with some Hyperbole

- A state-of-the-art PHY-101 physics system
- A seamless and fluid split screen local multiplayer
- An immersive and childish dialog and decision making system
- Pixel perfect platforming with that keeps you on the edge of your seat
- A flexible mapping system that makes modding a painless process
- Music that will cut you to your core

## Building and Running Raptr with CMake

1. [Download the 7-zip archive of Raptr's dependencies from here](https://github.com/justinvh/raptr/releases/download/v0.1-alpha.3/vcpkg-export-20180707-072728.7z) (or [zip](https://github.com/justinvh/raptr/releases/download/v0.1-alpha.3/vcpkg-export-20180707-072728.zip))

```
$ git clone https://github.com/justinvh/raptr.git raptr
$ cd raptr
$ 7z e vcpkg-export-20180707-072728.7z
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE:PATH="../vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" ..
```

You can now use Visual Studio 2017 to compile and build Raptr.

## Manually Fetching Dependencies

Raptr Depends on the following:

* bzip2
* catch2
* cxxopts
* fmt
* freetype
* libjpeg-turbo
* liblzma
* libpng
* libwebp
* picojson
* sdl2
* sdl2-image
* sdl2-ttf
* spdlog
* tiff
* tinytoml
* zlib

Which can be installed with vcpkg.exe with the following caveats:

### Patch fmt package

Unfortunately, the fmt package is backwards incompatible with spdlog at the moment, so you will have to checkout the port
at a specific version:

```
$ cd %USERPROFILE%\vcpkg
$ git checkout 178517052f42d428bb2f304946e635d3c1f318e9 -- ports/fmt
```

### Continue on!

You will want to first install the dependencies:

```
$ %USERPROFILE%\vcpkg\vcpkg.exe --triplet x64-windows install sdl2 sdl2-image sdl2-ttf picojson cxxopts spdlog tinytoml catch2
```

### Resume Building
Now you can specify the toolchain file and continue on:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/justinvh/raptr.git raptr
$ cd raptr/build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE:PATH="%USERPROFILE%/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" ..
```

## Building documentation

If you want to build the documentation, then you will need `doxygen` and 
`graphviz` projects installed. You can then use the `doxygen` target to 
build documentation.

## Running the tests

Raptr is built with Catch2 and CMake's CTest. You can run tests by building the `raptr-tests` component
and then running the `RUN TESTS` target.
