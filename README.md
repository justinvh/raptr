# Raptr - A Dinosaur Platformer

You're a dinosaur. The humans say you are a featherless cousin of the Deinonychus genus, but what do they know. Your buddies just call you Raptr.
Times are tough. You suspect that the humans only see you as a form of entertainment, yet your friends all seem to be comfortable with their place in the world.
Maybe it's time that you escape and start fresh. That'll help, right? Maybe it's time you find a way out of this all.

This project is maintained at [GitHub](https://github.com/justinvh/raptr).

## Installing and Running v0.1-alpha.8

It's pretty dang simple under 64-bit Windows right now. Raptr is currently in pure engine development.

1. [Download the 0.1-alpha.8 Windows 64-bit Release](https://github.com/justinvh/raptr/releases/download/v0.1-alpha.8/raptr-0.1.0-alpha.8-Release-win64.zip)
2. Extract that anywhere your heart desires.
3. Plug in a 360, GameCube, or Steam controller.
4. Go into the bin/ folder and run `raptr-client.exe`
5. Realize how much of an alpha this is :)

If you get a complaint about redistributables missing, then try downloading the [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017 - x64](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

## Current State: v0.1-alpha.8

## Building and Running Raptr with CMake

1. [Download the 7-zip archive of Raptr's dependencies from here](https://github.com/justinvh/raptr/releases/download/v0.1-alpha.7/vcpkg-export-20180711-180948.7z)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/justinvh/raptr.git raptr
$ cd raptr
$ 7z e vcpkg-export-20180711-180948.7z
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE:PATH="../vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" ..
```

You can now use Visual Studio 2017 to compile and build Raptr. If you want to manually fetch the dependencies and use vcpkg in its entirety, then [follow the manual build guide](https://github.com/justinvh/raptr/tree/master/doc/BUILDING_WITH_VCPKG.md) in the docs folder.

## Building documentation

If you want to build the documentation, then you will need `doxygen` and 
`graphviz` projects installed. You can then use the `doxygen` target to 
build documentation.

## Running the tests

Raptr is built with Catch2 and CMake's CTest. You can run tests by building the `raptr-tests` component
and then running the `RUN TESTS` target.
